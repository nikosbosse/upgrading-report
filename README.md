# Upgrading report for my PhD on infectious disease forecasting at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine

**Title: Using human insight and computational methods to improve real-time epidemic forecasting**

**Background**

Infectious disease modelling and forecasting can play a critical role in informing public health policy, as was highlighted by the COVID-19 pandemic. To improve infectious disease forecasting, learning from past predictions is indispensable. This requires appropriate tools to evaluate predictions, which can be used to obtain a deeper understanding of different forecasting approaches. Infectious disease forecasts are usually not only informed by model-based assumptions, but also implicitly by the opinion of the researchers implementing a model. This interplay between human judgement and model-based inference has not been studied in detail. Studying relative strengths of human forecasts and model-based approaches, and how to combine them, may therefore yield important insights. To further enhance predictive accuracy, individual predictions, be it from humans or models, are usually combined into ensembles. However, especially for small ensembles, it is not clear which aggregation method should be used and in which circumstances a model should be added to an existing ensemble or left out. 

**Aim**

The aim of this PhD is to improve infectious disease forecasting and its usefulness to public health officials in the UK and other countries. 


**Objectives**

1. Establish appropriate tools to evaluate predictions and ummarise best practices in forecast evaluation.
2. Collect predictions of COVID-19 from humans in Germany, Poland. Compare these human predictions against model-based forecasts to discern relative strengths and weaknesses of human forecasters vs. model-based approaches
3. Collect human forecasts of reported cases and deaths from COVID-19 in the UK as well as human predictions of the effective reproduction number $R_t$ to explore ways in which human insight and epidemiological modelling can be combined
4. Examine how different numbers of forecasts can best be combined to model ensembles and identify circumstances in which individual models contribute most to those ensembles.
